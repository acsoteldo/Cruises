## Getting Started: 
1. Report and presentation
2. data/: Contains cleaned datasets used for the analysis
3. notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks
4. visualizations/: PowerBI visualizations and dashboard
5. scripts/: Python and SQL scripts for data analysis

### Tools:
Excel, Jupyter, Python, SQL, PowerBI

### Data Sources:

The analysis will be based on the cleaned dataset, which includes the following fields:
* Ship_name: The name of the ship.
* Cruise_line: The cruise line company that operates the ship.
* Age: The age of the ship.
* Tonnage: The tonnage of the ship.
* Passengers: The number of passengers the ship can carry.
* Length: The length of the ship.
* Cabins: The number of cabins on the ship.
* Passenger_density: The density of passengers on the ship.
* Crew: The number of crew members on the ship.

## Problem Definition

### Relevance:

## Hypothesis
Older ships, larger ships (in terms of tonnage and length), and ships with higher passenger density have a greater environmental impact, characterized by higher fuel consumption and emissions. By identifying these relationships, we can target specific areas for improvement to enhance sustainability in the cruise industry.

## Vision
To transform the cruise industry into a model of environmental stewardship by leveraging data-driven insights to optimize ship operations, reduce emissions, and promote sustainable practices. This vision aims to ensure that cruising remains a viable and environmentally responsible travel option for future generations.

## Objective
* Analyze Ship Characteristics: Examine the dataset to understand how various ship characteristics (age, tonnage, passengers, length, cabins, passenger density, and crew) relate to operational efficiency.
* Identify Sustainability Indicators: Determine which factors are most strongly associated with high fuel consumption and emissions. Identify key indicators that can help predict a ship's environmental impact.
* Provide Recommendations: Based on the analysis, provide actionable recommendations for cruise lines to improve their sustainability practices. This may include strategies for fleet management, retrofitting older ships, or optimizing passenger density.
